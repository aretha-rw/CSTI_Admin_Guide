            <h2>Other Consoles</h2>
            
            <p>All other consoles contain more limited versions of <strong>Admin Console</strong> functions, but as you may need to assist a learner in their use, it’s helpful to be familiar with what functions appear in each console.</p>
            
            <h3>Training Organization Console</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>Training Organization Console</strong> provides access to the class list functions of <strong>Manage Classes</strong> and <strong>Manage Hybrids</strong>, to all student profiles, and to all facilitators listed under that training organization.<br><br>
            It does not provide access to any course or class editing functions and users’ passwords will not be visible on their profiles.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Coaches Console</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>Coaches Console</strong> allows coaches to view the profiles and training hours of all learners who have listed them as their coach. Users’ passwords will not be visible on their profiles.</p>
            
            <h3>Facilitators Console</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>Facilitators Console</strong> gives facilitators access to the <strong>Grade Students</strong> functions of every class and hybrid for which they’ve been listed as a facilitator.</p>
            
            <h3>Reporting Console</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>Reporting Console</strong> provides access to the same functions as the <strong>Manage Reports</strong> segment of the <strong>Admin Console</strong>.</p>
