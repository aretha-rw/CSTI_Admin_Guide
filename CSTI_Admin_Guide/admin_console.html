            <p>The <strong>Admin Console</strong> contains a range of management tools that allow administrators to schedule classes, make changes to learner accounts, add and remove roles, and pull reports.</p>

            <h3 id="courses-and-templates">Creating Courses and Templates</h3>
            
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_01.png">
            
            <p><strong>Create/Edit Courses</strong> (1) will allow you to build a new course or change details on an existing one. You may search for existing courses by title and edit them by clicking Select (2). Select <strong>Create New Course</strong> (3) to build a new course.</p>
            
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_02.png" class="left shrink50">
            
            <p><br><br>Fill in each field, then click <em>Save the course details</em> (4). Once your course has been saved, you can add prerequisites as needed by choosing them from the <em>Add a Prerequisite</em> (5) drop-down menu then clicking <em>Add</em>. Double-check that all fields are full, then click save again. Your course is now live.</p>
            <br>
                
            <p>If the course you’ve created belongs to a hybrid, you will begin the same way- by creating courses for each component of the hybrid- but you’ll also need to use the <strong>Create/Edit Modules</strong> and <strong>Create/Edit Templates</strong> to template the hybrid itself.
            </p>
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            
            <br>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_03.png" class="left"><img src="images/admin_console_04.png" class="right">
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            
            <p>You’ll begin by entering a title and description, then after clicking <em>Save the Module details</em> (1), you’ll be able to attach the course you already created to the module by choosing its ID from the list at the bottom of the page then clicking <em>Add</em> (2) to the left of the list. Repeat this for each component of the hybrid, and use the <em>Up</em>, <em>Edit</em>, <em>Remove</em>, and <em>Down</em> (3) links to edit and reorder the list as needed.

            Finally, you will create a template which allows the module to be displayed as a hybrid. Enter the title and description once more, click <em>Save the Template details</em> (4), then use the dropdown menu at the bottom to add your module (5). Your hybrid is ready for scheduling!
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, if you would like to change the order of your classes in <strong><a href="front.html#learning-experiences">Learning Experiences</a></strong>, go to the <em>Manage Course Order</em> tab.</p>
            
            <p class="top-link-p"><a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top.</a></p>

            <h3 id="manage-students">Manage Students</h3>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_05.png">
            
            <p>The <strong>Manage Students</strong> portion of the console allows admins to view and edit student profiles. You can search for learners by first or last name or by username (1). Clicking the header of a column like <em>Last Name</em> or <em>Username</em> (2) will sort the column alphabetically. Clicking <em>Select</em> (3) next to a learner’s name will give you access to their profile. You will rarely need to use the <strong>Create New</strong> section, as it’s generally more practical to simply create an account the standard way by going to <em>My Account</em> and clicking <em>Create one now</em>.</p>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_06.png" class="left shrink33"><img src="images/admin_console_07.png" class="right">
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            
            <p>If you need to check a learner’s hours or register them for a class, switch to the <strong>Classes</strong> (1) tab of their profile. <strong>Current</strong>, <strong>History</strong>, and <strong>Training Hours</strong> have the same functions as the tabs on your profile, while <strong>Register</strong> (2) allows admins to register learners for any available class. Once you’ve found a class using any of the available search functions, click <em>Select</em> (3) next to its title then click <em>Register</em>. You should see a confirmation message upon successful registration. Learners can even be registered for hidden or closed classes this way, making it especially useful for support tasks.</p>
            
            <p class="top-link-p"><a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top.</a></p>

            <img src="images/admin_console_08.png">
            
            <p>In <strong>Manage Classes</strong>, admins can schedule and make changes to specific offerings of CSTI courses. The All Classes (1) tab contains a list of every scheduled class. The list can be sorted alphabetically like the student list by clicking column headers (2), searched by title, ID, location, and provider (3), and filtered by visibility, completion, and more (4).</p>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_09.png" class="left shrink50">
            
            <p><br><br>Clicking a class’s title will bring up the <strong>Edit Class</strong> tab, where any information about the class (except it’s title) can be changed. 
            <br><br>Changes to date or facilitator will be saved automatically; all other changes must be saved by clicking <em>Save Details</em> (1). 
            <br><br>Clicking the <strong>Show Students</strong> (2) link at the top right will bring up the <strong>Grade Students</strong> tab.</p>
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>

            <p><br><br>This tab contains a list of all learners associated with the class. A series of check-boxes allows you to filter the list by learner status (1).
            <br><br>Each student has a drop-down menu that allows admins to set their status manually (2). <br><br>Once all students are in a final status- complete, dropped, no show, waived, or incomplete- the class may be marked complete (3). Completed classes are automatically hidden.</p>

            <h3>Create a class</h3>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_11.png">
            
            <p>To schedule a new class, go to the <strong>Create New Class</strong> tab and fill out each field:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><em>Class Title</em> determines which course your class will be based upon.</li>
                <li><em>Provider</em> will be filled in automatically based on the course.</li>
                <li><em>Location</em> is either the physical address of an in-person class or “Online” for a web-based training.</li>
                <li><em>ID</em> is an admin-specified string of letters and numbers that adds convenience to searching and allows staff to clarify exact classes in communication with support.</li>
                <li><em>Capacity</em> is the total number of learners that may register for the class.</li>
                <li>The <em>Offer Lodging</em> button generates a prompt upon registration asking learners if they require lodging.</li>
                <li>The <em>Completed</em> button is primarily for display- completion should be handled in <em>Grade Students</em>.</li>
                <li>The <em>Show</em> button toggles show/hide status. Hidden classes are unavailable for front-end registration.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Once all sections are filled in, click Save Details (10) and you’ll be able to set a date and facilitator for the class.</p>
            
            <p class="top-link-p"><a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top.</a></p>

            <h3 id="manage-hybrids">Manage Hybrids</h3>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_12.png">
            
            <p>The search functions found in the <strong>All Hybrids</strong> tab are almost identical to those found on the <strong>All Classes </strong>tab, with slightly fewer filtering options. If you have difficulty locating a class, be sure that <em>Show Hidden</em> (1) is checked.</p>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_13.png" class="left shrink60">
            
            <p><br><br><strong>Create New Hybrids</strong> is, however, quite different from <strong>Create New Class</strong>. To create a hybrid, all its component classes will need to be created first in <strong>Create New Class</strong>.<br><br>
                
            Once the components are created, the hybrid may be made by selecting a hybrid course from the <em>Based On</em> drop-down (1). <em>Title</em> and <em>Long Description</em> will fill automatically; <em>Short Description</em> (2) allows you to input a unique ID.
                
            <br><br>Next, enter a start and end date (3)- the <em>Start Date</em> is the first day of the first (non-WBT) class, and the end date is the last day of the last (non-WBT) class. Always check “Is this a Hybrid Class” (4); the other boxes are optional. Click <em>Save the Hybrid Class details</em> (5) to save your new hybrid.</p>
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_14.png">
            
            <p>Once your hybrid has been saved, you may add the component classes that you created earlier. At the bottom of the hybrid creation screen, you’ll find a drop-down menu for each piece of the hybrid. Select your classes and your hybrid will be complete. Class selections will be saved automatically.</p>
            
            <p class="top-link-p"><a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top.</a></p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h3 id="manage-users">Manage Users</h3>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_15.png">
            
            <p>The <strong>Manage Users</strong> area allows you to make changes to the roles of students, as well as hide and unhide accounts, unlock locked accounts, and merge duplicate accounts. In the <strong>All Users</strong> tab, users may be searched and sorted with the same tools as <strong><a href="#manage-students">Manage Students</a></strong>. Clicking <em>Select</em> next to any user will bring up a simple profile.</p>
            
            <img src="images/admin_console_16.png" class="left">
            
            <br><br><p>To unlock a user, simply click <em>Unlock User</em> (1) and agree to the prompt that will appear in your browser. Users can also be deleted with <em>Delete User</em> (2), but except for testing accounts, hiding a user is highly recommended over deleting them, as deletion is permanent and irreversible.<br><br>
            Finally, clicking <em>Edit User Info</em> (3) allows you to bestow or remove roles (4), which grant access to the various consoles. In addition, checking the <em>Active User</em> box will activate an account- useful for learners who fail to receive automatic confirmation emails upon creating an account.
            </p>
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>

            <h3 id="manage-coaches">Manage Coaches</h3>
            
            <p>Coaches may, again, be searched and sorted similarly to students and users. Clicking <em>Select</em> will allow an admin to view that coach’s <strong><a href="other_consoles.html">Coaches Console</a></strong> from their perspective; giving a list of people that they coach. Switching to the <strong>Coach Details</strong> tab will allow you to view their profile.<br><br>
            The <strong>Coach Requests</strong> tab allows you to view manual requests entered by learners. Each request should provide a name and email address for both the coach and the requester. To complete the request, first use <strong>Manage Users</strong> to ensure that the coach has an account with the coach role, then go to <strong>Manage Students</strong> and enter the coach’s name in the appropriate field of the student’s profile.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Manage Training Orgs</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>Manage Training Orgs</strong> area allows you to add and edit training organizations. On <strong>All Training Organizations</strong>, a list of all organization will appear. Clicking <em>Select</em> brings you to the <strong>Training Organization Details</strong> tab, where you may view and edit contact information and toggle the organizations visibility.
            The <strong>People in Charge</strong> tab allows you to assign access to specific training organizations’ console functions and designate a contact person for each training organization.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Manage Facilitators</h3>

            <p><strong>Manage Facilitators</strong> is used to assign users with the Facilitator role to specific training organizations. Once a facilitator has been assigned to a training org, clicking <em>Select</em> next to their name will bring open a view of their <strong><a href="other_consoles.html">Facilitators' Console</a></strong> which contains a limited version of the admin’s <strong><a href="#manage-students">Manage Students</a></strong> functions. Before adding a facilitator, first ensure that they have the facilitator role in <strong><a href="#manage-users">Manage Users</a></strong>.</p>
            
            <p class="top-link-p"><a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top.</a></p>

            <h3 id="manage-reports">Manage Reports</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Manage Reports</strong> provides a versatile platform for retrieving data from the learning management system. When you first enter this section, you’ll see a list of previously saved reports. To begin pulling a new report, switch to the <em>Create New Report</em> tab.
            Given the large number of potential options, it would be impractical to describe all possible reports. Instead, as one example, let’s say you want to create a list of every family peer specialist without the Admin role whose account was created in the last year. 
            </p>
            
            <img src="images/reports_1.png">
            
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by selecting <em>Create a new report based on: Student Information</em>.</li>
                <li>In the dropdown labeled <em>Available Fields</em>, select <em>First Name</em>, <em>Last Name</em> and <em>ob Category</em>. After selecting each label, click <em>Add To List -></em> to move each field to the list of <em>Included Fields</em>.</li>
                <br>
                <img src="images/reports_2.png">
                <br>
                <li>Once all fields have been moved, you can set conditions using the filters under <em>Select the criteria for the group</em>.</li>
                <li>Set the first column to <em>Job Category</em>, the <em>Operator</em> to <em>IN</em>, and the <em>Filter Value</em> to “I serve as a family peer specialist.” </li>
                <li>For the second filter, choose <em>Permissions</em>, <em>NOT IN</em>, and “Admin.” Make sure that the <em>Relation to Next Condition</em> switch for the first row to <em>AND</em>.</li>
                <br>
                <img src="images/reports_3.png">
                <br>
                <li>Under <em>Set the date</em> filter, set the drop-down to <em>Create date</em> and click <em>Range</em>. Set the start date to one year ago and leave the end date as today’s date.</li>
                <li>Enter a title if you would like to save your report, then click <em>Prepare Report</em>.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Once your report is ready, you can either view it by clicking <em>Display Report</em> or make changes with <em>Change Criteria</em>. Upon viewing the report, you will have the option to download it so that it can be further edited and analyzed in programs like Microsoft Excel.</p>
