            <p>Clicking <em>My Account</em> while logged in will take you to your <strong>Profile</strong>. You can find your certifications and total training hours from the current fiscal year (1) on the front page of your profile. Clicking <em>Edit Profile</em> (2) will allow you to update any information on your profile. Clicking the green <em>Menu</em> icon (3) will bring up a list of profile sections. <strong>Profile</strong> (4) will bring you back to the front page of your profile from other sections.</p>

            <h3 id="access-online-trainings">Access Online Training</h3>

            <p>Choosing <strong>Access Online Training</strong> (5) will open a new window. You will see a loading screen for several seconds, then be directed to a new website where you can take your web-based trainings.<br><br>See <strong><a href="moodle.html">Moodle</a></strong> for more details.</p>

            <h3 id="upcoming-classes">Upcoming Classes</h3>

            <p>The <strong>Upcoming Classes</strong> section has three tabs: <strong>Current</strong>, <strong>History</strong>, and <strong>Training Hours</strong>. For more information on the <strong>History</strong> and <strong>Training Hours</strong> tabs, see <strong><a href="#training-resume">Training Resume</a></strong>.</p>

            <img src="images/upcoming_classes_1.png">

            <p>In the <strong>Current</strong> (1) tab, you’ll see a list of all classes in which you are registered, waiting, or pending.<br><br>

            The first column provides a link to <em>Drop Class</em> (2). After entering a reason for your drop, click Submit Drop to drop the class. Your supervisor will be notified. If you need to drop a class within two days of its start date , you’ll have to contact Support.<br><br>
            Next, you’ll see the <em>Title</em>, <em>Provider</em>, and <em>Location</em> of the class. Clicking the location will open a new window with more detailed information on physical addresses.<br><br>
            The <em>Start Date</em> of all web-based trainings is Available Now. <em>Status</em> will show whether you are registered or waitlisted for the class. Finally, the <em>Details</em> (3) link will provide additional information such as the name of your facilitator and the capacity of the class.

            <h3 id="training-resume">Training Resume</h3>

            <p>The <strong>Training Resume</strong> section of your profile contains the same tabs as <strong><a href="#upcoming-classes">Upcoming Classes</a></strong>, with a focus on the <strong>History</strong> and <strong>Training Hours</strong> tabs.</p>

            <img src="images/upcoming_classes_2.png">

            <p><em>History</em> (1) contains a list of every class in which you have a final status (2) (See <strong><a href="learner_status.html">Learner Statuses</a></strong> for details). It provides similar information as the Current tab. <em>Training Hours</em> (3) displays all hours you have learned along with the date of completion and class title.<br><br>
                
            Clicking <em>Print as a PDF</em> will produce a PDF copy of your <em>Training Resume</em>, which may be used as formal proof of completion for any class listed.<br><br>
                
            If you believe that you’ve completed a class but don’t see it on your training resume, check both the <em>Current</em> and <em>History</em> tabs. Web-based trainings should confer hours automatically upon completion, while in-person classes may remain in registered status for several days after the class as they are graded manually by their providers. If you don’t see the class under the <em>Current</em> tab, check the <em>History</em> tab to see if you might have been marked incomplete or no-show.<br><br>
            If you believe you’ve been marked incorrectly in a class, please contact Support.
