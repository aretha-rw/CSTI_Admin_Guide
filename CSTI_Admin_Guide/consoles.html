            <h2>Common terms</h2>

            <p>All definitions refer to the term’s technical use and are specific to the CSTI.<br><br>
            <strong>Class</strong>: A specific, scheduled instance of a <em>course</em>- <em>class</em> is to <em>course</em> as “Denver” is to “city.”<br><br>
            <strong>Coach</strong>: A learner that supervises other learners and has access to the profiles of each learner they supervise.<br><br>
            <strong>Course</strong>: The template from which specific classes are built.<br><br>
            <strong>Hybrid</strong>: An object which groups two or more courses together into a single unit. When a learner registers for a hybrid class, they automatically register for all its components at once. A hybrid class is considered incomplete unless all its component classes are completed.<br><br>
            <strong>LMS</strong>: Abbreviation of Learning Management System. Most segments of the website that you will work with are part of the LMS, including the profile and all consoles.<br><br>
            <strong>Module</strong>: Refers both to the piece of a hybrid object that links its components and to a section of a web-based training which contains multiple <em>SCORM</em> packages.<br><br>
            <strong>Role</strong>: Roles are sometimes also referred to as permissions; a learner’s roles grant them access to consoles and their functions.<br><br>
            <strong>SCORM</strong>: Abbreviation of Sharable Content Object Model. A standard format for interactive online trainings.<br><br>
            <strong>Template</strong>: The object on which individual hybrid classes are based. <em>Template</em> is to <em>Hybrid</em> as <em>Course</em> is to <em>Class</em>.<br><br>
            <strong>Training Organization</strong>: An organization which develops and facilitates classes on behalf of the CSTI and serves as a contact for training-specific questions. The contact designated for each training organization will appear in all registration-related communications.<br><br>
            <strong>WBT</strong>: Abbreviation of Web-Based Training. Web-based trainings are completed by accessing a SCORM package, which then reports back completion data to the LMS. Webinars and video-conferences are not WBTs.</p>
