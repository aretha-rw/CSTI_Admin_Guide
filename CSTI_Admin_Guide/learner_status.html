            <h3>Non-Final Statuses</h3>
            
            <p>Learners in these statuses will see their class in the <strong>Upcoming Classes</strong> section of their profile. If a class has one or more learners in one of these statuses, it cannot be closed.</p>
            
            <p>
            <strong>Registered:</strong> The learner is currently enrolled and awaiting a class. For WBTs, learner has immediate access to their training.<br><br>
            <strong>Waiting:</strong> The learner has attempted to register for a class that was full and will be moved to Registered if an opening appears.<br><br>
            <strong>Pending:</strong> The learner has attempted to register for a class that has special registration requirements and will be moved to Registered if those requirements are fulfilled.<br><br>
                
            <h3>Final Statuses</h3>
            
            <p>Learners in these statuses will see their class in the <strong>History</strong> section of their profile.</p>
            
            <p>
            <strong>Completed:</strong> The learner has finished a class and met all requirements for receiving credit. This is the only status that bestows training hours.<br><br>
            <strong>Cancelled:</strong> The learner was in a non-final status for a class that was cancelled.<br><br>
            <strong>Dropped:</strong> The learner has either dropped or been dropped from a class. Conventionally, drops are entered prior to a class to allow waiting learners to be registered. The supervisor of a learner who is dropped from a class will be notified. If the class has already been closed, one of the following statuses is more appropriate.<br><br>
            <strong>No Show:</strong> The learner did not attend a class and did not submit a drop. A notification is automatically sent to the supervisor of any learner marked <em>No Show</em>.<br><br>
            <strong>Waived:</strong> The learner did not attend a class and did not submit a drop, but an appropriate explanation was given and <em>No Show</em> status is not appropriate.<br><br>
            <strong>Incomplete:</strong> A learner attended or began a class but left some component unfinished. For example, a learner fully attends the classroom portion of a Hybrid but not the WBT, or attends a classroom-only training but leaves several hours early.<br><br></p>
